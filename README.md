🌍 Data Analysis of Kenya & Developing Countries

Web Scraping • Trend Analysis • Comparative Insights • Dashboard

📌 Overview

This project analyzes Kenya and other developing countries using real-world data collected through web scraping.
The objective is to transform publicly available online data into structured datasets, analyze trends and patterns, and present insights through interactive visualizations and dashboards.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline — from data collection to insight generation.

🎯 Key Goals

Collect real-world data using web scraping

Clean and preprocess raw datasets

Perform exploratory and comparative analysis

Identify economic and social trends

Visualize insights using charts and dashboards

🌐 Data Collection

Data is sourced from publicly available websites including:

Government portals

Development and economic organizations

Open data platforms

Tools Used for Scraping

requests

BeautifulSoup

Selenium (for dynamic content)

Data is collected only from publicly accessible sources and used for educational and analytical purposes.
